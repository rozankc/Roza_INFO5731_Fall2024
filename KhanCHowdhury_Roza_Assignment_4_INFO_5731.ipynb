McElwaine, Physicist\\n          \\n               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody \\\"knew\\\" that a \\n          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would \\n          violate the \\\"laws\\\" of physics.  All of the \\\"experts\\\" and \\n          \\\"authorities\\\" said so. \\n          \\n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  \\\"The \\n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \\n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \\n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \\n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \\n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \\n          physical fact to be.\\\" \\n          \\n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \\n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \\n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \\n          crash). \\n          \\n               Today, orthodox physicists and other \\\"scientists\\\" are \\n          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' \\n          Technologies, using negative terms such as \\\"pseudo-science\\\" \\n          and \\\"perpetual motion\\\", and citing so-called \\\"laws\\\" which \\n          assert that \\\"energy cannot be created or destroyed\\\" (\\\"1st law \\n          of thermodynamics\\\") and \\\"there is always a decrease in useful \\n          energy\\\" (\\\"2nd law of thermodynamics\\\").  The physicists do not \\n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \\n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \\n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \\\"science\\\" and help to \\n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \\n          modern theories. \\n          \\n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \\n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \\n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \\n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \\n          \\n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \\n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \\n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \\n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \\n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \\n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \\n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \\n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \\n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \\n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \\n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \\n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \\n          \\n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \\n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \\n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \\n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic \\n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \\n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \\n          \\\"Science & Mechanics\\\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\\\"Amazing \\n          Magnet-Powered Motor\\\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \\n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \\n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \\n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \\n          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete \\n          descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the \\n          U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA  \\n          22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.

They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to \\n          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\\\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\\\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \\\"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\\\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock \\n          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \\\"Tokamaks\\\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\\\"New Times\\\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \\\"laws\\\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \\\"absolute\\\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \\\"Nothing But Motion\\\" (1979) and \\\"The \\n          Universe of Motion\\\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \\\"heat death\\\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \\\"laws\\\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \\\"low-quality energy\\\" into \\\"high-quality \\n          energy\\\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' \\n          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \\\"The Path of the \\n          Masters\\\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \\\"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \\\"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\\\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.

Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, \\n          personal computers, etc.).

theory explains the universe much \\n          better than modern orthodox theories including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their

It *does*\\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\\n>which are not.)\\n\\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \\n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n', 'From: lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady)\\nSubject: Re: Science and methodology (was: Homeopathy ... tradition?)\\nSummary: Asking the wrong question is the most fundamental error. \\nKeywords: science   errors   Turpin  \\nOrganization: University of Hawaii (Mathematics Dept)\\nExpires: Mon, 10 May 1993 10:00:00 GMT\\nLines: 80\\n\\n\\nAvoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \\nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \\nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \\nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \\nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \\nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \\n\\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \\nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \\ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \\n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \\n\\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \\nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \\nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \\nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \\na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \\nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \\ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \\nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \\ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \\nthrough the mistakes they made.  \\n\\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \\n    (Dick King) writes:\\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\\n>  ....\\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\\n>         ....\\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\\n\\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it\\'s not supported by\\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it\\'s not science.\"\\n\\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \\nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \\nof science.  \\n\\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \\nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \\nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \\nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don\\'t in the least believe that this \\nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \\nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \\ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \\narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \\n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \\nwith anything worthwhile.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\\n\\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin\\'s\\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\\n\\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \\nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \\nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \\ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \\nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n', 'From: Ed Hew <edhew@xenitec.on.ca>\\nSubject: biz.sco.* newsgroups/mlists FAQ (periodic posting)\\nOrganization: XeniTec Consulting Services, Kitchener, ON, CANADA\\nSummary: how to subscribe (and why)\\nKeywords: biz, sco, newsgroups, mailing lists\\nLines: 123\\n\\n\\n              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists\\n              ---------------------------------------------\\n   \\n   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful\\n   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET\\n   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it\\'s companion mailing list.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10.

Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\\n\\n\\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \\nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \\nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \\nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\\n\\t\\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \\ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \\nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\\n\\n\\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \\narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\\nis the most recent.\\n\\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \\nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\\n\\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \\nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\\n\\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\\n\\n\\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \\nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\\n\\n\\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\\n\\n\\tAlso: \\n\\n\\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \\n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\\n\\n\\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \\nnon-PostScript printers.\\n\\n\\tSome vendors\\' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \\ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \\ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \\nhave a \\'screendump\\' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \\nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\\n\\n\\tSome vendors\\' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \\nsupport for printing xwd files, but you\\'ll typically need some other package \\nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\\n\\n\\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \\nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \\ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\\n\\n\\tThis can\\'t be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \\ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\\n\\n\\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer\\'s useful++ \\nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \\namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \\ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\\n\\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center\\'s IMtools (\\'imconv\\' in \\nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\\nIt\\'s available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\\n\\n\\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost\\'s xloadimage, a\\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \\nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \\nGraeme Gill\\'s updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \\nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\\n\\n\\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \\ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \\nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \\ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \\nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \\nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \\nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n\\n\\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \\nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\\n\\n\\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\\n\\n\\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \\nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \\nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\\n\\n\\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \\ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \\na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \\nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \\nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\\n\\n\\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \\nexport\\'s contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\\n\\n\\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\\nas part of Sam Leffler\\'s libtiff package and it is also available on\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]\\nxtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.\\n\\n\\tA version of Lee Iverson\\'s (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool\\nis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package \\nalso includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\\n\\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \\ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \\nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \\npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\\n\\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\\n\\n[last updated 10/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\\n\\n\\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \\n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \\n\\tXTerm*font: \\t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\\n\\tXTerm*boldfont:\\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\\n\\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\\n\\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\\n\\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \\nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (\\') \\nis Alt-\\'. \\n\\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \\n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\\n\\n\\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \\na resource specification like this:\\n\\t\\txterm*geometry: 80x24\\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \\nBut its popup menus don\\'t; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\\n\\t\\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\\n\\n\\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \\nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \\nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \\n\\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \\nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.

Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \\ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \\nby a slash.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\\n\\nThe answer lies in changing xdm\\'s xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \\nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \\n\\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \\nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \\n\\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\\n\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.

We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n', 'From: pat@rwing.UUCP (Pat Myrto)\\nSubject: New Clipper Chip Proposal from the Guv...\\nKeywords: encryption,privacy,individual rights,legalities,big brother\\nOrganization: Totally Unorganized\\nLines: 310\\n\\nI saw this article posted in a local newsgroup.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let\\'s go out \\nto the cherry blossoms.  We\\'ll do like the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \\nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \\nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \\nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \\ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \\nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \\nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \\nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \\nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \\nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \\nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \\nabout that yesterday afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \\nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \\nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \\ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \\ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that\\'s where we are.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \\nboth making concessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that it\\'s at that \\nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \\nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \\nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it\\'s going to \\ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he\\'s willing to \\nmake those adjustments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the subject of a VAT --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \\nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I\\'m not going to go \\ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \\nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \\nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \\nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \\nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \\nabout it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \\nthere\\'s a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \\nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At the meetings that he\\'s had with his own task \\nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \\npossible options would be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that that has been \\npresented for a decision, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \\noption?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \\nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \\nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not saying he didn\\'t know it was being \\nconsidered, though, are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it\\'s being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He knew that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it\\'s being \\nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \\nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \\ndon\\'t even know that it\\'s --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he didn\\'t say he was considering, did he, at \\nthis stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we\\'re \\ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \\nconsidered -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven\\'t reviewed \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \\nrepeated. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \\nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \\nit were to be considered he\\'d let us know, and having it trickle out \\nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \\ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.  I mean, it is \\nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \\nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \\nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \\ncome out not from you people, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \\nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What I\\'m saying is, though, that the President said \\nhe would let us know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \\nit\\'s not going to be on the program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On March 25th. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \\nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \\na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \\nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \\nClinton administration, the headline is -- I\\'ll look at it right \\nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about his remark that if it were being \\nconsidered, he\\'d tell us about it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration\\'s concerned, \\nand he\\'d let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \\nthis morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn\\'t have to be dragged out of \\nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \\nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \\nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \\norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \\nanswered the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re saying here that it didn\\'t have to be \\ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \\nconsidering it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \\nPainfully clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \\nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \\nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \\nanswered that it was being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, The New York Times --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why do it yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \\nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \\noranges numbers in order to portray last month\\'s unemployment figures \\nin a way that was supportive of the President\\'s job stimulus bill, \\nbut which turned out to be totally false.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if it was totally \\nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \\nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \\nsay that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \\nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what\\'s he \\ndoing about it, if so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \\nmistake was made, it won\\'t happen again, and that\\'s the end of the \\nmatter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that the same information that goes to the \\nPresident?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There\\'s two separate pieces of \\ninformation.  I think that\\'s where the confusion was.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \\nthat was made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \\nThe New York Times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  Not to my knowledge.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \\nAnything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wasn\\'t the President given an erroneous spin on \\nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I\\'m not sure.  Both \\nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \\nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \\nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn\\'t do it again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \\nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \\nwork, we\\'re gratified.  But that doesn\\'t take away from the need to \\nget this jobs package going.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \\nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \\namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \\nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \\nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \\nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there\\'s no \\nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don\\'t know that they discussed the \\ntiming like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you believe that you\\'re closer or getting closer \\nthis week than you were last week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we\\'re going \\nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \\nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don\\'t know where the \\nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don\\'t know what\\'s \\ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \\ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \\nhas changed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work on \\nit.  We\\'ll know when the votes are taken.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \\nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn\\'t go \\nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \\nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \\ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \\naccept.  This week you\\'re talking to him.  Is that because you\\'ve \\nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn\\'t going to work?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s because Senator Dole wanted \\nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He initiated the conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \\nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \\nsay he\\'s making --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that that\\'s exactly \\nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn\\'t have any indication that \\nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \\nand the President doesn\\'t want to compromise.  And the President \\ndoesn\\'t want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \\nit through, he will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \\nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \\nthe actual vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when that will \\nhappen, but I think that it\\'s very possible that we\\'ll come forward \\nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \\nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \\nfirst one was some discussion of this and I\\'ll get back to you \\ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \\nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a question of how \\ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \\npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \\nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \\nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \\nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \\ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we\\'ll let you know.  \\nAnd I\\'m not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \\nwe\\'ve talked about or that we\\'ve offered anything in a hard way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \\nPresident and Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \\nto talk to Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \\nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \\nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think it was a negotiation \\nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.  I know they \\ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \\nabout the programs they cared about.  I don\\'t know if they got to the \\nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \\nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \\nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \\nKohl or Feingold?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he\\'s talked to them, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is the President considering the more \\npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \\nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \\nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \\nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \\nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \\nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \\nquestion, I\\'ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \\nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \\nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \\nnot true.  It\\'s actually waste water money.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s waste water money for \\nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \\nbecause it\\'s waste water money, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \\noverall. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the implication from your statement the other \\nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \\nWould you agree that\\'s not the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure of the specifics.  I \\nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \\nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \\non a VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when.  I just \\ndon\\'t know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \\nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So sometime since March 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s right.  I don\\'t know \\nthe exact date.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \\nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \\nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \\nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \\nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he\\'s proposed, \\nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he\\'s already \\nproposed?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'ve said all we have to \\nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there\\'s just no -- this is \\nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \\nThe President hasn\\'t made any further decisions beyond that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn\\'t \\nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn\\'t replace the \\nincome tax, for instance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \\nSenator Dole\\'s press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \\nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \\nhave a chance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \\nforward?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \\nif the President were to decide to do it.  It\\'s not in consideration \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \\ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \\nconsideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \\nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \\nthat has to be considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \\nThat\\'s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \\nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what he said. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \\ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to get into the \\ndeliberations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, George --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \\nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \\nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that the only thing that\\'s changed since his \\nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \\ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \\nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \\nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But this is the President\\'s knowledge that these \\ngroups had come forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \\nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \\npublished positions in the newspapers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group\\'s \\npresentations to them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve briefed him \\n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \\nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \\ngroups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \\nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \\nthat he had enunciated previously?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know, it\\'s just they\\'ve had \\nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \\nhealth care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President wasn\\'t aware of those longstanding \\npositions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \\nObviously, he\\'s been a governor for a long time and he knows the \\nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What we\\'re trying to figure out here -- you\\'re \\ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \\nchange in the President\\'s attitude toward the VAT between February \\nand now --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s attitude hasn\\'t \\nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \\ntable.  So did you.  And you\\'re saying that the only thing that\\'s \\nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you\\'re also \\ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don\\'t see the change.  \\nIf these groups haven\\'t had any change in their position that\\'s been \\nmade to the President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they\\'ve made the \\npresentations to the health care task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s no relationship at all between the fact \\nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \\nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he ever suggested \\nthat they would produce all the revenue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \\nappropriate ways to finance health care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don\\'t know that \\nhe said anything to refute that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \\nthere wouldn\\'t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \\nof core benefits --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t think that the task \\nforce ever suggested that there would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \\nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \\nprograms?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t comment on a hypothetical \\nsituation.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \\nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \\nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \\non the VAT tax.  When he does, we\\'ll tell you and we\\'ll explain the \\nimplications then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \\nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \\nforce has prompted this consideration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have the specific.  I just \\ndon\\'t have that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \\nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \\nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \\noptions are?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \\nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \\nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \\nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not going to comment on \\nthem, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope of the need?  How much are you \\ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what the health care task \\nforce is looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since there\\'s not going to be any briefing on the \\nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \\nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \\ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \\nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does no mean yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes and no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know.  I saw the \\nPrime Minister\\'s press conference where he was asked the question \\nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \\nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \\ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \\nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \\nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \\nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \\nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \\nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \\nvery clearly.  I don\\'t necessarily want to agree with your \\ncharacterization of the Prime Minister\\'s comments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \\nnumerical targets -- is that what he\\'s going to discuss with \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re going to have a broad \\ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don\\'t want to get into \\nthose specifics until after the meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   That\\'s the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \\nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \\ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \\nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \\nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \\nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \\npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \\nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \\nMiyazawa himself, and then he\\'ll make the comment on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \\nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \\nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \\nmore, the Japanese saying that that\\'s not what they heard?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we\\'re going to continue to \\npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \\nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \\nwe\\'re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \\npackages.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work \\nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \\nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments on \\nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It\\'s a rather emotional response.\"  \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \\nHouse condone that kind of remark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \\nChristopher\\'s remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \\nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we\\'re trying to find \\nanswers for. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \\nspecific term?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In connection with that, doesn\\'t it seem that with \\nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \\ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \\nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \\nair strikes, anything that can be done?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \\nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \\nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \\nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \\npressure at this time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \\nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \\nthe presidency?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re wrong.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor increased sanctions, and we\\'re talking to our allies about the \\narms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \\ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \\nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \\nchange your thinking?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we\\'re going to listen to \\nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \\nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \\nand talking about the arms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \\nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \\ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \\nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s exactly what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s true.  But \\nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \\nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \\nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \\nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \\nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \\nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \\neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \\ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \\nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don\\'t \\nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \\nall, I don\\'t know why they\\'d be fighting it so much.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are the First Lady\\'s tax returns going to be \\nreleased?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s a joint tax return.  \\nAnd it will be probably later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \\norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \\nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think there\\'s any proposal \\nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s something that the President promised during \\nthe campaign that he would do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s anything that\\'s on his plate right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about on this issue.  \\nI assume that he\\'ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \\ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \\ndifferent groups and communities.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if that\\'s scheduled --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s probably going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s a good thing you asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who\\'s probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s all I know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if it\\'s at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know what time it is.  I \\ndon\\'t even know for sure if it\\'s going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \\nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve asked, but \\nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \\ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it\\'s not \\nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \\nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know the specific \\ntiming of something like that, but it\\'s certainly something under \\ndiscussion and something we\\'ve been working on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Campaign finance reform?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think it will be next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you\\'re working \\non?  I missed the question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we\\'re working on.  \\nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn\\'t know \\nanything about that but it\\'s something we\\'ve certainly been working \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \\nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \\nof town on the day of the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s got to be at the Senate \\nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he\\'s also going to be giving a \\nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \\non Sunday, as he did last year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \\non the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the gays.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \\nPresident\\'s schedule for the day, certainly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    George, what day is the publisher\\'s speech?  Is \\nthat Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And Saturday he\\'ll be in Jamestown?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So you\\'re just going to be in Jamestown for one \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I\\'m not sure.  I don\\'t know how \\nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don\\'t \\nknow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain if we had the meeting \\n-- I don\\'t know about open to the press, but we would have told you \\nabout it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \\nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t say it was going to be in \\nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn\\'t -- I\\'m not say that it\\'s \\nnot, but I didn\\'t say that it was.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \\ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \\nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \\nsure --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn\\'t do \\nanything like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What marching orders did the President give to \\nGeneral Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \\nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \\nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \\nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \\nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \\nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \\nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He\\'ll be looking at Vietnam\\'s \\nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he\\'ll also look \\ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \\nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \\nmilitary archives.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \\nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vietnam says it\\'s a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \\nat this stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s not completed yet, and it\\'s \\nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \\nVietnamese.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \\nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \\nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \\nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don\\'t have any final \\ndetermination.  We\\'re going to wait for the complete review; when we \\nhave it, we\\'ll make a judgment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know you don\\'t have any final determination, but \\ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \\nthat\\'s a likely possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t want to characterize \\nit in any way until the review is complete.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \\nin Boston?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \\ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I\\'m not positive.  \\nYes, I expect, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was in on the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \\nand the answer is yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \\nreport this morning the President\\'s distressed about some of his \\npress clippings and that perhaps he\\'s distressed with you about that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \\nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \\nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \\npoint out that he\\'s answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \\nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \\noccasions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many were while he was jogging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that\\'s actually a very \\ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \\narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \\ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \\nHe\\'s had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \\nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \\nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s answered questions in the --\\nEast Room.  He\\'s had five in the East Room, he\\'s had one in the Oval \\nOffice, he\\'s had one in the Rose Garden, he\\'s had one or two in the \\nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \\nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he\\'s had 17 interviews with local \\ntelevision anchors.  He\\'s met with the editorial board of The \\nPortland Oregonian.  He\\'s had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \\nHe\\'s had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \\nConnecticut --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \\narticle implies that he doesn\\'t --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why doesn\\'t he like us?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think I\\'m going to comment \\nabout this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \\ndispleasure publicly?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \\ndiscussions between the President and myself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \\nWebber?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \\nplayer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That is an authentic letter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \\nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \\nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \\nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can\\'t comment on a \\nproposal he hasn\\'t made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \\nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \\ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \\nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The military issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain it will come up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \\nprepare for tomorrow\\'s meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s had briefing memos.  He\\'s had \\ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \\nTrade Representative and others.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     report yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he has the report \\nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know that the \\nreport\\'s been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \\nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \\nthat there\\'s a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \\nfeels that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \\nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \\nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \\nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \\nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \\nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \\nhistory.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you\\'re invited.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END                    1:34 P.M.

It\\nwas a pleasure to read them.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nYou are welcome, Zane.\\n \\nZane...\\n\"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I\\nwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.\\nI mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you\\nhave read the book you\\'ve been rescued from all of the error and pain that\\nwill result in your Christian life?\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\n(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith\\n    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn\\'t grounded in the Word of God and sound\\n    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I\\n    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.\\n    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin\\'s monthly magazine (and they\\n    still send it to me), and also Copeland\\'s (also, still sent to me).\\n    It wasn\\'t until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:\\n    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were\\n    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying\\n    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my\\n    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that\\n    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in\\n    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!\\n \\n(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it\\'s\\n    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into\\n    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and\\n    has now fallen into atheism.  I\\'m still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).\\n \\n(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been\\n    a `follower\\' of Copeland for 15 years.

That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as\\n    my lending CIC to people in the church.\\n \\nI\\'m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and\\nhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.\\nWhat heresies?\\n    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became\\n        one with him.\\n    B. Jesus\\' death on the cross wasn\\'t enough to atone.\\n    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by\\n        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling\\n        over Him there.\\n    D. Jesus was `born-again\\' in hell.\\n    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after\\n        the resurrection.\\n    F. We are gods.\\n \\nThese are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings\\nupon request.\\n \\nZane...\\n\"Or what does it do for you?

It\\'s imperative that leadership\\nbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that.\\n \\nAlso, let\\'s examine a passage of Scripture...\\n* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some\\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,\\n* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\\nedifying of the body of Christ,\\n \\nThese ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one\\nindividual church, but for \"the body of Christ\".\\nPaul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also\\na teacher -\\n1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and\\nfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach\\neverywhere in every church.\\n1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each\\none, so let him walk.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

What \\nwas he killed for. He hadn\\'t hurt anyone, hadn\\'t said any word he oughtn\\'t \\nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \\nthe government--why my husband was killed.\\n\\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\\nHe doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \\nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we \\nlived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\\ndon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\\nanswer . . .

I think\\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \\n\\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don\\'s tie... This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n', 'From: umturne4@ccu.umanitoba.ca (Daryl Turner)\\nSubject: Re: Too Many Europeans in NHL\\nNntp-Posting-Host: gibson.cc.umanitoba.ca\\nOrganization: University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\\nLines: 76\\n\\nIn article <rauser.734062608@sfu.ca> rauser@fraser.sfu.ca (Richard John Rauser) writes:\\n>\\n>   Here\\'s the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL.

They give their\\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\\n\\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\\nplayers.  It doesn\\'t belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\\ncan do what they want.  While a \\'Canadian content\\' rule might be enforcable\\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn\\'t even TRY to push their\\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\\n\\nIncreasing the competition for the \\'elite\\' positions, in most cases, would\\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that\\'s an NHL team\\'s primary farm\\nclub, you don\\'t hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.

I\\'ve grown up with Europeans playing on \\'my\\' team, and some of those\\nplayers were the among the best in the world.

New York prohibits their use in\\n    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,\\n    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They\\n    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.\\n    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other\\n    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.\\n\\nQ:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?\\n\\nA:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,\\n    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe\\n    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.\\n    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently\\n    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate\\n    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.\\n    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected\\n    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a\\n    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned\\n    on.\\n\\nQ:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?\\n\\nA:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance\\n    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target\\n    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR\\n    system.\\n\\nQ:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be\\n    able to handle it? \\n\\nA:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US\\n    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a\\n    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the\\n    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the\\n    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.\\n    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low\\n    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar\\n    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,\\n    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such\\n    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use\\n    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:\\n    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they\\n    are used (or else, don't speed.)\\n\\nQ:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?\\n\\nA:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.\\n    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.\\n    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the\\n    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the\\n    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.\\n\\nDriving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What are understeer and oversteer?\\n\\nA:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a\\n    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)\\n    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to\\n    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they\\n    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',\\n    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)\\n    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that\\n    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into\\n    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle\\n    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance\\n    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing\\n    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle\\n    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or\\n    spinning.\\n\\n    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car\\n    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the\\n    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling\\n    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to\\n    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle\\n    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater\\n    slip angle than the front wheels.\\n\\nQ: What is a rev-matched downshift?\\n\\nA: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear\\n   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally\\n   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop\\n   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle\\n   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to\\n   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.\\n\\nQ: What does heel-and-toe mean?\\n\\nA: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while\\n   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot\\n   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you\\n   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to\\n   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;\\n   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side\\n   on the throttle.\\n\\n   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the\\n   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing\\n   the same thing.\\n\\nQ: What is double-clutch downshifting?\\n\\nA: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of\\n   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for\\n   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the\\n   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with\\n   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch\\n   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission\\n   speed up.\\n\\n   The procedure is as follows:\\n   (0) declutch\\n   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral\\n   (2) engage clutch\\n   (3) match revs\\n   (4) declutch\\n   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear\\n   (6) engage clutch\\n\\n   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.\\n   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the\\n   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or\\n   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.\\n   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at\\n   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good\\n   condition.\\n\\nQ: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and\\n   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?\\n\\nA: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and\\n   2) almost never.\\n\\n   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times\\n   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the\\n   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine\\n   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite\\n   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from\\n   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*\\n   major) part of the equation.\\n\\n   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really\\n   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically\\n   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the\\n   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.\\n   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads\\n   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply\\n   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.\\n\\n   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the\\n   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced\\n   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the\\n   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making\\n   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end\\n   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car\\n   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'\\n   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of\\n   caveats could go on for page after page.\\n\\nQ: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according\\n   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate\\n   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?\\n\\nA: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.\\n\\n   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics\\n   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,\\n   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a\\n   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating\\n   temperature.\\n\\n   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser\\n   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a\\n   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been\\n   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match\\n   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire\\n   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses\\n   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling\\n   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire\\n   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will\\n   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its\\n   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some\\n   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like\\n   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.\\n   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal\\n   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of\\n   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)\\n\\n   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,\\n   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters\\n   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than\\n   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible\\n   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of\\n   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques\\n   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?\\n\\nA:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked\\n    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names\\n    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER\\n    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.\\n\\n    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,\\n    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some\\n    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may\\n    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this\\n    is only speculation at this time.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\", 'From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\\nSubject: Re: Slavery (was Re: Why is sex only allowed in marriage:...)\\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\\nLines: 208\\n\\nIn <1993Apr4.200253.21409@ennews.eas.asu.edu> guncer@enuxha.eas.asu.edu (Selim Guncer ) writes:\\n\\n>You might not like what Bernard Lewis writes about, label him\\n>as a Zionist or such to discredit him etc. \\n\\nYou misrepresent me, Selim.

His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n>The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES,\\n>when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex.\\n>I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines, I wrote an\\n>incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not\\n>want his concubine to get pregnant etc., which is contrary\\n>to the notion that \"sex is for procreation only\".

I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n>It is very natural to think that\\n>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic\\n>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm\\n>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of \\n>the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial \\n>revolution.  Well, rules have changed and the status quo has driven \\n>Muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a \"heathen\" world. \\n>Muslim countries have failed economically, they were unable to \\n>accumulate any wealth - directly due to the uncomprimising economic\\n>rules in the Quran. In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled\\n>after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home,\\n>but increase your wealth by conquering places.  \\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n>When this stopped,\\n>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.\\n>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education\\n>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health\\n>statistics are miserable etc.. \\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims \\n>for following the Quran. \\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n>Your idea is baseless from historical\\n>facts, it is a poor utopia, \\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n>while my ideas are derived from social\\n>and economic history. \\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n>My solution to all Muslims is simple:\\n>CUT THE CRAP, \\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT \\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE\\n>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n', 'From: gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare)\\nSubject: Re: EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance (Pt II)\\nNntp-Posting-Host: cunixb.cc.columbia.edu\\nReply-To: gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare)\\nOrganization: PhDs In The Hall\\nLines: 201\\n\\nv140pxgt@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu (Daniel B Case) writes:\\n>gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare) writes...\\n>>v140pxgt@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu (Daniel B Case) writes:\\n>>>gld@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Gary L Dare) writes...\\n>\\n>Okay, but do doctors willingly testify against each other in \\n>malpractice cases when they do go to court (obviously, absolutely \\n>essential to prove malpractice)?

Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.

He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.

Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\\'s Bi-centennial.\\n                                                (cont)\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n', 'From: baez@guitar.ucr.edu (john baez)\\nSubject: End of the Space Age\\nArticle-I.D.: galaxy.29034\\nOrganization: University of California, Riverside\\nLines: 82\\nNntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.edu\\n\\nThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s\\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......\\n\\n\"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\\nnow,\" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\\'s Jet\\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  \"We\\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\\'t\\nhave....

RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the\\n four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection\\n (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and\\n non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the\\n Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or\\n Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained\\n (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were\\n shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something\\n weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may\\n change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the\\n README file that this law not be violated:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent\\n residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README\\n file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a\\n product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping\\n distribute it.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For\\n originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of\\n origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message\\n (See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the\\n sender\\'s private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving\\n authority, can use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm\\n that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography\\n in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information\\n also may be in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM\\n standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the\\n near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be\\n stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with\\n interoperability.\\n\\n7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,\\n RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so\\n parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate\\n channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong\\n a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash\\n function will be used if this is accepted as true.\\n\\n8)  What is PEM?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a\\n working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n9)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for\\n key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM\\n is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.\\n\\n10)  Isn\\'t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?\\n\\n This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,\\n the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section\\n 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be\\n met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421\\n addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key\\n cryptography.\\n\\n This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that\\n everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of\\n patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key\\n cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive\\n (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter\\n and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are\\n compressed with a patented algorithm.)\\n\\n11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?\\n\\n RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company\\n specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a\\n firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.\\n patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:\\n\\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\\n      (\"Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770\\n\\n      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus\\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\\n\\n      Cryptographic Communications System and\\n      Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829\\n\\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\\n\\n PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key\\n cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for\\n example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)\\n PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of\\n companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their\\n products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their\\n patents.\\n\\n RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than\\n its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its\\n author\\'s desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.\\n However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got\\n interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some\\n people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing\\n code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\"\\n award.\\n\\n12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography\\n Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the\\n key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as\\n those of lots of other people\\'s keys.  This does not mean your keys\\n are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were\\n generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.\\n\\n13)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability\\n   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be\\n   compatible with anything other than itself.\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which\\n   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own\\n   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its\\n   patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without\\n   either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n   (See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of\\n   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal\\n   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but\\n   it hasn\\'t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening\\n   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User\\'s Guide:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.\\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP\\n   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n Unfortunately, it\\'s not distributed separately from the program,\\n which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to\\n liability concerns.\\n\\n14)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was\\n written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough\\n to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally\\n accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n15)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with\\n MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution\\n of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM\\n messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft\\n Internet documents exist on the matter.\\n\\n16)  What is TIS/PEM?\\n\\n Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy\\n Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was\\n rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)\\n rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don\\'t know\\n much more than that.\\n\\n17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\\n\\n You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which\\n discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and\\n what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is\\n probably key distribution.\\n', 'From: clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement)\\nSubject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption\\nOrganization: National Institute of Standards & Technology\\nDistribution: na\\nLines: 282\\n\\n\\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\\n     ---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\\n\\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n\\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\\n\\n\\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\\n\\n\\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\\nenforcement.\\n\\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n\\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n \\n     \\n', 'From: pat@rwing.UUCP (Pat Myrto)\\nSubject: New Clipper Chip Proposal from the Guv...\\nKeywords: encryption,privacy,individual rights,legalities,big brother\\nOrganization: Totally Unorganized\\nLines: 310\\n\\nI saw this article posted in a local newsgroup.

Perhaps\\nsuggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from\\nacquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs\\nany possible benefits, IMO.\\n\\nBTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been\\npromoting, in an even more disturbing form.\\n\\nThat said, with no further comment, the article follows:\\n\\n------------ Begin included article ---------\\n\\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\\n     ---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\\n\\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n\\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\\n\\n\\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\\n\\n\\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\\nenforcement.\\n\\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n\\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.

You can use this command:\\n\\t\\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \\ncommand-line.

Some platforms also have tools which \\ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \\nhave a \\'screendump\\' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \\nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\\n\\n\\tSome vendors\\' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \\nsupport for printing xwd files, but you\\'ll typically need some other package \\nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\\n\\n\\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \\nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \\n\\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \\ndistribution.

PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\\n\\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center\\'s IMtools (\\'imconv\\' in \\nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\\nIt\\'s available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\\n\\n\\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost\\'s xloadimage, a\\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \\nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \\nGraeme Gill\\'s updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \\nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\\n\\n\\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \\ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \\nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \\ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \\nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \\nit, and save it in one of the available formats.

There is \\na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \\nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \\nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\\n\\n\\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \\nexport\\'s contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\\n\\n\\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\\nas part of Sam Leffler\\'s libtiff package and it is also available on\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

If you give \\na resource specification like this:\\n\\t\\txterm*geometry: 80x24\\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \\nBut its popup menus don\\'t; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\\n\\t\\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\\n\\n\\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \\nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \\nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \\n\\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \\nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n        %t      The territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n        %c      The codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \\ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \\nby a slash.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\\n\\nThe answer lies in changing xdm\\'s xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \\nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \\n\\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \\nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \\n\\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\\n\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).

Remember\\n: those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5\" floppies? These drives\\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn\\'t there\\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\\n\\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\\n\\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\\n\\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\\nquoted as saying that a 2.5\" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\\nproductized.\\n\\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\\nto get MDs accepted.\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\\n\\t\\t\"They didn\\'t like the rates, they don\\'t like the poll tax,\\n\\t\\t and they won\\'t like the council tax.\"   - Nicholas Ridley   \\n', 'From: jrm@elm.circa.ufl.edu (Jeff Mason)\\nSubject: PRICE SLASHED!!

Ahhh..\\nTalk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.

A poorly maintained \\n>rifle is dangerous, but only to the user; since it doesn\\'t\\n>endanger others, there is no justification for such restrictions.\\n\\n\\tI remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5\\' a reasonable space\\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5\\' restriction, or the possibility\\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\\n\\n>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to\\n>protect their homes and families. Using nuclear weapons close \\n>to home will not accomplish this.\\n\\n\\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n>There is, however, another problem: In any case of civil war,\\n>the strength of the militias fighting on each side should\\n>reflect the popular will. If the public is split 67% versus\\n>33%, then the minorities\\' militias should be at a 2:1 disadvantage.\\n>Such a need for popular support would, hopefully, prevent \\n>insurrections unless the people really were behind the rebels.\\n>But heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia \\n>could distort this: What if the 33% minority included all the\\n>tank and artillery owners?\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small \\n>minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power\\n>through violence. To prevent this, it may be necessary to give \\n>control of heavy weapons (e.g. those which only a small number\\n>of individuals would own _and_ whose firepower would grossly \\n>distort the relation between popular support and military \\n>strength) to someone other that individual militiamen. This is\\n>certainly not a good thing, but I think it is the lesser of two evils.\\n>Whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body,\\n>responsive to the will of the people.\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ \"state\" we\\n>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to\\n>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely\\n>destructive to that end for that same government to control \\n>the militia\\'s arms. But the United States have several levels\\n>of government, each able to act independently, but not all\\n>likely targets of rebelion.\\n>As such, rebelions against state and\\n>local governments are very unlikely.

The risk of abuse, while\\n>still something to consider, is far less than the similar risk\\n>were the federal government in control.\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select\\n>militia should privide the militia\\'s heavy weapons and highly-trained\\n>specialists. For the reasons I have outlines above, I think \\n>these heavy weapons (tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc...) are\\n>better off being kept by local governments than by a small \\n>number of individuals.

Similarly, the\\n>select militia should be incapable of action without the\\n>aid of the general militia.\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard\\'s\\n>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local\\n>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds\\n>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and\\n>>the like.\\n>\\n>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, \\n>general militias.\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n>Perhaps the National Guard isn\\'t as close to my conception of\\n>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to \\n>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry\\n>arm of the regular army.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.\\n\\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

All the clamor \\nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \\ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \\ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \\ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \\nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \\nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \\nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \\npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \\nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \\nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \\nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known \\nfor a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a \\nwomen is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and \\nnot give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \\ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \\nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\\n\\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \\na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn\\'t it make sense for humans \\nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \\nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \\nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \\ninfections should decline.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n']\n",

So as we \\nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \\npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \\n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \\n11:00 a.m. he\\'ll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \\nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \\n12:30 p.m. he\\'ll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \\nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he\\'ll meet with the police organizations.\\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he\\'ll do his weekly photos with the \\nvarious groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A photo op with Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

It\\'s a closed meeting.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about the lunch?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there\\'s no coverage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are no meetings --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President been given any information by the \\nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \\nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \\nVietnamese on that subject?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \\nof business.  It\\'s high on the agenda on something that they\\'ll \\ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \\nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn\\'t \\ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it\\'s \\nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \\nabout first.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \\nyesterday about the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \\nnight.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the outcome of that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re continuing to work toward some kind \\nof an agreement on a jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \\nway flexible on this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we\\'re hopeful that we\\'re going \\nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \\nkind of an agreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \\nscale down his program -- is that what he\\'s trying to do, buy it down \\nto where Dole will sign on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he\\'s trying to protect as much of it \\nas he can.  But it\\'s important to him to get some kind of a jobs \\npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \\nwe reach some conclusions on that, we\\'ll let you know.  But at the \\nmoment, he\\'s continuing to consult with members of Congress \\nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe he talked to any other \\nRepublicans yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think anything is scheduled, but I \\nwouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We were led to believe that the President called \\nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \\nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \\npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \\nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \\nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \\nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \\nbut it was both.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the President\\'s mind, are they linked \\npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \\nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \\nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I can\\'t talk about specifically what \\narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \\nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \\nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \\nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \\npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \\nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \\ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \\npackage, and we\\'re still hopeful that we\\'ll get some kind of jobs \\npackage through the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \\nnow with Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'s discussing options with him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \\nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \\nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \\nSenate for the jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But specifically, that you\\'ve lost Democrats other \\nthan Shelby?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe so.  There hasn\\'t been a \\nvote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about Kohl?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Kohl and Feingold?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn\\'t been a vote yet.  And we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \\nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \\nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If you\\'re weren\\'t worried about Kohl and Feingold, \\nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \\nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \\nfunding if this jobs package doesn\\'t pass.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ll let you draw your own conclusions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \\nother Republicans again today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s nothing specifically scheduled, but \\nagain, I wouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \\nany other states today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  What we\\'ve done is we\\'re in the process of \\nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \\nthink it\\'s entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \\nup, we\\'ll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \\nhow their states would benefit from this package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you share those with us?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \\nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday\\'s questions and subsequent \\nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \\nbeen given?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing\\'s changed since yesterday.  I think \\nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \\nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \\nhas not made a decision on, and I don\\'t think we have anything to add \\nto that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \\ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I\\'m not going \\nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \\nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don\\'t \\nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \\nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there\\'s been plenty of public \\ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don\\'t think \\nI want to add to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In February, though, the President said that this \\nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \\nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \\nchange its mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \\nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They\\'re \\nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \\nspecific options that will be covered by the President\\'s health care \\nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \\non it.  And beyond that, I don\\'t have anything to add.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You haven\\'t answered the question.  It wasn\\'t being \\nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President\\'s \\ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then suddenly --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What happened?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \\nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \\nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \\nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \\ntax.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \\nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \\nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \\nhasn\\'t been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \\nlooking at it, as they\\'re looking at a wide variety of options, and \\nno decisions have been made.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \\ntask force is working.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \\nall options, and they\\'ve taken that mandate seriously and they\\'re \\nconsidering all options.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s not the impression that the President \\nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \\nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \\nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \\nnot on the table, not an option. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If it changes I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bring him on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President\\'s \\nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s what Alice Rivlin\\'s comments and Donna \\nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \\norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \\n--\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn\\'t -- no, Alice Rivlin\\'s not a \\nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \\norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \\ncouple of days that it\\'s something that\\'s being looked at.  We \\nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don\\'t have anything to add to that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it because he has very few options?\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \\nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \\nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it\\'s now up to the \\ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \\nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \\nthe President?  \\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group\\'s mission at \\nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \\nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \\nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \\nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \\ncontext, and at this point he\\'s not -- that presentation has not been \\nmade, but it\\'s something that he will hear and he has not made a \\ndecision on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \\nthough he specifically ruled it out?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \\nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \\nthis form of taxation?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s simply a statement of fact.  The \\nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \\nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \\nthey\\'re looking at is the VAT. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \\nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \\nthat you were telling us that it was not?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know what the specific timing of \\ntheir drafting of options is.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \\nconsideration?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President\\'s \\ncomments.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won\\'t raise \\nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there\\'s no decisions that have been made \\non how to pay for the health care plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'m asking whether the projections --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s a number of options depending on how \\nthe plan is structured.  You can\\'t decide how much the plan is going \\nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \\nyou can\\'t discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \\nuntil you know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, we\\'ve been told that they have a computer \\nmodels on a number of possible packages.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether they have now determined \\nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \\nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we\\'re \\nnot going to answer until -- there\\'s a number of options being \\nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \\ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \\nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \\ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \\nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \\nin his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \\nnature of the daily -- they\\'re not daily, but the quasi-regular \\nbriefings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, you have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he\\'s not \\nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \\nhim as an option.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That doesn\\'t mean he hasn\\'t heard about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to get into the details of \\nwhat\\'s discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn\\'t \\nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn\\'t looked at it in terms of \\npaying for medical coverage, or hasn\\'t looked at it in general?  \\nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \\nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \\nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \\ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \\ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \\nit\\'s something that he\\'s thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \\nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I\\'m saying is that in the process \\nof the working groups it\\'s something that he hasn\\'t considered yet.  \\nIt\\'s something that the working groups will present to him among the \\nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \\nhealth care issues are being discussed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s your statement from this podium that no \\ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \\nthe option has not been presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \\nby George\\'s statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \\nnothing to add to what\\'s already been said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \\nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \\nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \\nso that it would be less regressive?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment any further on what \\nmight happen if.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \\nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \\nyou\\'d exclude food and energy --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment on the specific \\nstructure of a decision that hasn\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala\\'s \\ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \\ngroups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know specifically what --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you check for us, because that\\'s a real \\nimportant credibility question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the task force was brought together this \\nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \\nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \\nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \\nand a half when you\\'ve been denying that a VAT tax would be \\nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we\\'ve said all that we have to say.  \\nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \\nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \\nadd.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \\nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \\nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we\\'re asking is, if \\nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \\nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \\nit\\'s a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \\nus.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe that anyone has ever come \\nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \\nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re not trying to shade answers or \\ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I\\'ve said what I have to say about \\nthis issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All we were trying to find out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you\\'re trying to find out \\nand I\\'ve given you the answers, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re trying to find out what changed -- what made \\nit an option again.  That\\'s the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but it wasn\\'t an option before.  How can you \\ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they\\'re obviously \\nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They\\'ll \\npresent it to the President at some point and he\\'ll make a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \\nthe table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s clearly on the table. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \\nhis mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s back on the table, Bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he change his mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn\\'t made a \\ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it\\'s on the table.  It\\'s \\nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \\nthis we\\'ll let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there\\'s like two options -- either he \\nchanged his mind or the working groups think they\\'re authority \\nexceeds the President\\'s.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to look at all options; they\\'ve done that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \\nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \\navailable. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing\\'s planned.  I think someone will \\nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \\nthrough the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re used to be walked line-by-line through the \\npresidential tax forms.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ve seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we have one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don\\'t think there will be any kind of \\na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \\nyour questions about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they file a joint form?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did he file it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it\\'s being filed today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \\nmeeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No backgrounder today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We can\\'t give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \\none day, it\\'s too confusing.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \\nforce in Bosnia.   They\\'ve both said that, A, they never ruled it \\nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \\nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s been no change in our policy towards \\nBosnia.  We have always said that we\\'d consider --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \\npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re people whose opinions carry weight \\ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they\\'ve \\ninitiated.  But there\\'s been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \\nalthough we\\'re considering a number of options right now.  If the \\nSerbs don\\'t come back to the negotiating table, if they don\\'t sign on \\nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \\nwhich we\\'ve been saying regularly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \\nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \\nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \\ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re continuing to put pressure on them \\nevery day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which doesn\\'t work so --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \\nWe\\'re going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \\nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \\nthe 26th.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You say it\\'s having an effect -- can you give us \\nany documentation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'d be happy to provide somebody to talk to \\nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s been no -- you have not been able to \\nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \\neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they\\'ve had effect in Serbia \\nand we think they\\'ve had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I\\'ll be \\nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \\nyou\\'d like.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \\nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \\nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven\\'t \\nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \\nprovide something along those lines?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \\nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll have to work with Congress on the \\ndetails of that package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \\nget?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that\\'s new money, in addition to the \\n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \\nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \\nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a concern, though, about offering \\nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \\nconcern with Vancouver; you didn\\'t want to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \\nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \\nin the Fiscal \\'93 budget.  What we\\'re looking at now is a little bit \\nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \\nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \\napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with Congress to make that happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \\nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \\nthis process moves forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \\nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \\nCongress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \\nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \\nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President\\'s jobs \\npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \\ngive kids something to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who are they?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s members or leadership from three \\norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \\nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \\nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \\nof Police Associations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \\nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \\n$400 million that\\'s in the FY \\'94 budget for disarmament?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So this would be the $700 million that\\'s in the \\nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \\nmillion already in the budget.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \\nFiscal \\'94 --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll work with Congress on the exact \\nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \\nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \\nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \\ncalling Bob Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \\nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \\nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \\ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \\nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \\nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\\nDoes the White House feel that you\\'re getting too close to these \\nChambers of Commerce?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That\\'s an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \\nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \\nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \\nbeing too close.  I think that\\'s interesting.  But no, we\\'re thrilled \\nby the support we\\'ve received from the national Chamber and local \\nChambers across the country and we\\'ll continue to work with them on \\nthis and other initiatives.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the status of the President thinking about \\ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s on his calendar.  I think he\\'ll almost \\ncertainly go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All three days?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven\\'t figured out exactly when he\\'ll be \\nthere yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it open to coverage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \\nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re still looking at that.  We haven\\'t \\nmade a final decision about how we\\'ll -- who will make a statement or \\nwhat --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn\\'t rule it \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about an AIDS czar?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s coming.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anything on the weekend?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s been a suggestion that he\\'s going to this \\nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \\nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he\\'s been \\ndiscussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic \\nretreat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The weekend?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don\\'t know -- the only thing on \\nright now is the radio address on Saturday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Any travel plans?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He\\'s not going to be off campaigning for his \\nstimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s possible.  Yes, I think it\\'s likely \\nthat we\\'ll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know.  I\\'ll check.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don\\'t believe so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going \\nto be focused on the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m sure it will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END10:10 A.M.

PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\\n\\n                               END10:25 A.M.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we do this on the lawn?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let\\'s go out \\nto the cherry blossoms.  We\\'ll do like the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the stimulus package dead? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \\nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \\nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \\nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \\ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \\nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \\nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \\nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \\nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \\nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \\nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \\nabout that yesterday afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \\nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \\nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \\ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \\ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that\\'s where we are.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \\nboth making concessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that it\\'s at that \\nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \\nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \\nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it\\'s going to \\ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he\\'s willing to \\nmake those adjustments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the subject of a VAT --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We have a problem with the five minutes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \\nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I\\'m not going to go \\ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \\nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \\nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \\nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow, have they done that directly through \\nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \\nabout it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \\nthere\\'s a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \\nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At the meetings that he\\'s had with his own task \\nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \\npossible options would be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that that has been \\npresented for a decision, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \\noption?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \\nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \\nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not saying he didn\\'t know it was being \\nconsidered, though, are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it\\'s being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He knew that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it\\'s being \\nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \\nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \\ndon\\'t even know that it\\'s --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he didn\\'t say he was considering, did he, at \\nthis stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we\\'re \\ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \\nconsidered -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven\\'t reviewed \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \\nrepeated. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \\nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \\nit were to be considered he\\'d let us know, and having it trickle out \\nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \\ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.  I mean, it is \\nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \\nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \\nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \\ncome out not from you people, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \\nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What I\\'m saying is, though, that the President said \\nhe would let us know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \\nit\\'s not going to be on the program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On March 25th. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \\nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \\na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \\nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \\nClinton administration, the headline is -- I\\'ll look at it right \\nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about his remark that if it were being \\nconsidered, he\\'d tell us about it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration\\'s concerned, \\nand he\\'d let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \\nthis morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn\\'t have to be dragged out of \\nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \\nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \\nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \\norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \\nanswered the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re saying here that it didn\\'t have to be \\ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \\nconsidering it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \\nPainfully clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \\nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \\nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \\nanswered that it was being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, The New York Times --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why do it yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \\nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \\noranges numbers in order to portray last month\\'s unemployment figures \\nin a way that was supportive of the President\\'s job stimulus bill, \\nbut which turned out to be totally false.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if it was totally \\nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \\nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \\nsay that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \\nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what\\'s he \\ndoing about it, if so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \\nmistake was made, it won\\'t happen again, and that\\'s the end of the \\nmatter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that the same information that goes to the \\nPresident?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There\\'s two separate pieces of \\ninformation.  I think that\\'s where the confusion was.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \\nthat was made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \\nThe New York Times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  Not to my knowledge.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \\nAnything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wasn\\'t the President given an erroneous spin on \\nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I\\'m not sure.  Both \\nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \\nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \\nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn\\'t do it again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \\nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \\nwork, we\\'re gratified.  But that doesn\\'t take away from the need to \\nget this jobs package going.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \\nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \\namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \\nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \\nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \\nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there\\'s no \\nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don\\'t know that they discussed the \\ntiming like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you believe that you\\'re closer or getting closer \\nthis week than you were last week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we\\'re going \\nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \\nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don\\'t know where the \\nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don\\'t know what\\'s \\ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \\ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \\nhas changed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work on \\nit.  We\\'ll know when the votes are taken.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \\nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn\\'t go \\nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \\nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \\ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \\naccept.  This week you\\'re talking to him.  Is that because you\\'ve \\nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn\\'t going to work?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s because Senator Dole wanted \\nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He initiated the conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \\nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \\nsay he\\'s making --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that that\\'s exactly \\nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn\\'t have any indication that \\nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \\nand the President doesn\\'t want to compromise.  And the President \\ndoesn\\'t want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \\nit through, he will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \\nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \\nthe actual vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when that will \\nhappen, but I think that it\\'s very possible that we\\'ll come forward \\nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \\nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \\nfirst one was some discussion of this and I\\'ll get back to you \\ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \\nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a question of how \\ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \\npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \\nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \\nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \\nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \\ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we\\'ll let you know.  \\nAnd I\\'m not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \\nwe\\'ve talked about or that we\\'ve offered anything in a hard way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \\nPresident and Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \\nto talk to Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \\nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \\nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think it was a negotiation \\nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.  I know they \\ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \\nabout the programs they cared about.  I don\\'t know if they got to the \\nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \\nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \\nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \\nKohl or Feingold?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he\\'s talked to them, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is the President considering the more \\npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \\nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \\nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \\nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \\nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \\nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \\nquestion, I\\'ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \\nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \\nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \\nnot true.  It\\'s actually waste water money.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s waste water money for \\nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \\nbecause it\\'s waste water money, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \\noverall. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the implication from your statement the other \\nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \\nWould you agree that\\'s not the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure of the specifics.  I \\nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \\nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \\non a VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when.  I just \\ndon\\'t know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \\nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So sometime since March 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s right.  I don\\'t know \\nthe exact date.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \\nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \\nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \\nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \\nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he\\'s proposed, \\nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he\\'s already \\nproposed?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'ve said all we have to \\nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there\\'s just no -- this is \\nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \\nThe President hasn\\'t made any further decisions beyond that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn\\'t \\nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn\\'t replace the \\nincome tax, for instance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \\nSenator Dole\\'s press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \\nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \\nhave a chance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \\nforward?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \\nif the President were to decide to do it.  It\\'s not in consideration \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \\ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \\nconsideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \\nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \\nthat has to be considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \\nThat\\'s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \\nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what he said. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \\ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to get into the \\ndeliberations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, George --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \\nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \\nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that the only thing that\\'s changed since his \\nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \\ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \\nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \\nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But this is the President\\'s knowledge that these \\ngroups had come forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \\nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \\npublished positions in the newspapers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group\\'s \\npresentations to them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve briefed him \\n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \\nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \\ngroups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \\nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \\nthat he had enunciated previously?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know, it\\'s just they\\'ve had \\nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \\nhealth care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President wasn\\'t aware of those longstanding \\npositions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \\nObviously, he\\'s been a governor for a long time and he knows the \\nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What we\\'re trying to figure out here -- you\\'re \\ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \\nchange in the President\\'s attitude toward the VAT between February \\nand now --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s attitude hasn\\'t \\nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \\ntable.  So did you.  And you\\'re saying that the only thing that\\'s \\nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you\\'re also \\ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don\\'t see the change.  \\nIf these groups haven\\'t had any change in their position that\\'s been \\nmade to the President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they\\'ve made the \\npresentations to the health care task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s no relationship at all between the fact \\nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \\nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he ever suggested \\nthat they would produce all the revenue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \\nappropriate ways to finance health care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don\\'t know that \\nhe said anything to refute that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \\nthere wouldn\\'t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \\nof core benefits --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t think that the task \\nforce ever suggested that there would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \\nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \\nprograms?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t comment on a hypothetical \\nsituation.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \\nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \\nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \\non the VAT tax.  When he does, we\\'ll tell you and we\\'ll explain the \\nimplications then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \\nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \\nforce has prompted this consideration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have the specific.  I just \\ndon\\'t have that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \\nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \\nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \\noptions are?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \\nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \\nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \\nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not going to comment on \\nthem, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope of the need?  How much are you \\ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what the health care task \\nforce is looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since there\\'s not going to be any briefing on the \\nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \\nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \\ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \\nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does no mean yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes and no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know.  I saw the \\nPrime Minister\\'s press conference where he was asked the question \\nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \\nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \\ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \\nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \\nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \\nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \\nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \\nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \\nvery clearly.  I don\\'t necessarily want to agree with your \\ncharacterization of the Prime Minister\\'s comments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \\nnumerical targets -- is that what he\\'s going to discuss with \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re going to have a broad \\ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don\\'t want to get into \\nthose specifics until after the meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   That\\'s the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \\nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \\ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \\nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \\nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \\nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \\npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \\nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \\nMiyazawa himself, and then he\\'ll make the comment on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \\nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \\nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \\nmore, the Japanese saying that that\\'s not what they heard?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we\\'re going to continue to \\npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \\nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \\nwe\\'re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \\npackages.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work \\nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \\nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments on \\nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It\\'s a rather emotional response.\"  \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \\nHouse condone that kind of remark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \\nChristopher\\'s remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \\nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we\\'re trying to find \\nanswers for. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \\nspecific term?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In connection with that, doesn\\'t it seem that with \\nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \\ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \\nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \\nair strikes, anything that can be done?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \\nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \\nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \\nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \\npressure at this time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \\nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \\nthe presidency?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re wrong.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor increased sanctions, and we\\'re talking to our allies about the \\narms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \\ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \\nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \\nchange your thinking?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we\\'re going to listen to \\nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \\nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \\nand talking about the arms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \\nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \\ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \\nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s exactly what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s true.  But \\nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \\nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \\nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \\nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \\nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \\nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \\neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \\ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \\nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don\\'t \\nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \\nall, I don\\'t know why they\\'d be fighting it so much.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are the First Lady\\'s tax returns going to be \\nreleased?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s a joint tax return.  \\nAnd it will be probably later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \\norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \\nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think there\\'s any proposal \\nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s something that the President promised during \\nthe campaign that he would do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s anything that\\'s on his plate right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about on this issue.  \\nI assume that he\\'ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \\ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \\ndifferent groups and communities.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if that\\'s scheduled --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s probably going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s a good thing you asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who\\'s probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s all I know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if it\\'s at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know what time it is.  I \\ndon\\'t even know for sure if it\\'s going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \\nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve asked, but \\nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \\ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it\\'s not \\nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \\nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know the specific \\ntiming of something like that, but it\\'s certainly something under \\ndiscussion and something we\\'ve been working on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Campaign finance reform?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think it will be next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you\\'re working \\non?  I missed the question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we\\'re working on.  \\nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn\\'t know \\nanything about that but it\\'s something we\\'ve certainly been working \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \\nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \\nof town on the day of the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s got to be at the Senate \\nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he\\'s also going to be giving a \\nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \\non Sunday, as he did last year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \\non the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the gays.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \\nPresident\\'s schedule for the day, certainly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    George, what day is the publisher\\'s speech?  Is \\nthat Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And Saturday he\\'ll be in Jamestown?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So you\\'re just going to be in Jamestown for one \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I\\'m not sure.  I don\\'t know how \\nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don\\'t \\nknow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain if we had the meeting \\n-- I don\\'t know about open to the press, but we would have told you \\nabout it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \\nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t say it was going to be in \\nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn\\'t -- I\\'m not say that it\\'s \\nnot, but I didn\\'t say that it was.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \\ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \\nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \\nsure --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn\\'t do \\nanything like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What marching orders did the President give to \\nGeneral Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \\nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \\nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \\nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \\nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \\nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \\nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He\\'ll be looking at Vietnam\\'s \\nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he\\'ll also look \\ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \\nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \\nmilitary archives.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \\nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vietnam says it\\'s a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \\nat this stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s not completed yet, and it\\'s \\nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \\nVietnamese.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \\nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \\nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \\nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don\\'t have any final \\ndetermination.  We\\'re going to wait for the complete review; when we \\nhave it, we\\'ll make a judgment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know you don\\'t have any final determination, but \\ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \\nthat\\'s a likely possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t want to characterize \\nit in any way until the review is complete.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \\nin Boston?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \\ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I\\'m not positive.  \\nYes, I expect, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was in on the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \\nand the answer is yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \\nreport this morning the President\\'s distressed about some of his \\npress clippings and that perhaps he\\'s distressed with you about that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \\nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \\nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \\npoint out that he\\'s answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \\nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \\noccasions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many were while he was jogging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that\\'s actually a very \\ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \\narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \\ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \\nHe\\'s had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \\nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \\nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s answered questions in the --\\nEast Room.  He\\'s had five in the East Room, he\\'s had one in the Oval \\nOffice, he\\'s had one in the Rose Garden, he\\'s had one or two in the \\nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \\nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he\\'s had 17 interviews with local \\ntelevision anchors.  He\\'s met with the editorial board of The \\nPortland Oregonian.  He\\'s had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \\nHe\\'s had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \\nConnecticut --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \\narticle implies that he doesn\\'t --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why doesn\\'t he like us?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think I\\'m going to comment \\nabout this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \\ndispleasure publicly?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \\ndiscussions between the President and myself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \\nWebber?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \\nplayer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That is an authentic letter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \\nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \\nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \\nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can\\'t comment on a \\nproposal he hasn\\'t made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \\nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \\ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \\nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The military issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain it will come up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \\nprepare for tomorrow\\'s meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s had briefing memos.  He\\'s had \\ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \\nTrade Representative and others.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     report yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he has the report \\nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know that the \\nreport\\'s been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \\nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \\nthat there\\'s a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \\nfeels that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \\nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \\nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \\nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \\nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \\nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \\nhistory.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we come up to your office?

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\\n\\n   (more, more)\\n -30-\\n\", 'From: royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (Roy Crabtree)\\nSubject: Re: That Kill by Sword, Must be Killed by Sword\\nOrganization: Red Barn Data Center\\nLines: 191\\n\\nIn article <sandvik-210493014635@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes:\\n>In article <C5tCz8.4z9@rbdc.wsnc.org>, royc@rbdc.wsnc.org (Roy Crabtree)\\n>wrote:\\n>> In article <20APR199306173611@utarlg.uta.edu> b645zaw@utarlg.uta.edu (stephen) writes:\\n>> >In article <sandvik-190493201048@sandvik-kent.apple.com>, \\n>> >sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes...\\n>> ...\\n>> >>So are you happy now when 70+ people, including innocent kids,\\n>> >>died today?\\n>> \\n>> \\tIt\\'s amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.\\n>> \\tOne thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself\\n>> \\tagainst the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)\\n>> \\tmade  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.\\n>\\n>Frankly speaking I don\\'t care who started this whole show.

It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.

I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.

So far, Israe \\ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \\nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \\nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTim: \\n\\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \\nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \\ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \\n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \\nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \\nor \"visitors\").\\n\\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \\nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \\nfrom its territory.\\n\\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\\n\\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled?

Previously I\\nhad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU\\nbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.\\n\\nYour mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted\\nbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.\\nI didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher\\nspeeds.\\n\\nParts\\n\\n\\tClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of\\n\\tspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the\\n\\toscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend\\n\\tgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.\\n\\n\\t   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for\\n\\t   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:\\n\\n\\t\\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\\n\\t\\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\\n\\t\\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\\n\\n\\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\\n\\n\\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\\n\\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\\n\\t   \\n\\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\\n\\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\\n\\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\\n\\n\\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \\n\\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\\n\\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\\n\\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \\n\\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\\n\\t   \\nProcedure\\n\\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\\n\\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\\n\\tthe back of the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\\n\\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\\n\\t\\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\\n\\t\\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\\n\\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\\n\\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\\n\\t\\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\\n\\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\\n\\t\\n\\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\\n\\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\\n\\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\\n\\t\\n\\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\\n\\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\\n\\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\\n\\tproper care.\\n\\t\\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\\n\\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\\n\\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\\n\\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\\n\\t50 mhz clock.\\n\\t\\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\\n\\t\\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\\n\\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\\n\\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \\n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\\n\\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\\n\\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\\n\\t\\n\\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\\n\\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\\n\\tbe astounded. \\n\\t\\n\\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\\n\\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\\n\\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\\n\\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\\n\\tproblem.\\n\\t\\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\\n$50 in parts.\\n\\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\\n\"]\n",

He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\\ndon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\\n\\n   May 19, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

You will hear lots of\\npeople cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command\\n(a truely gnarly hack), but don\\'t believe them.  You also will hear\\npeople saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in\\nMicrosoft\\'s Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:\\n\\n  \"JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if\\n  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for\\n  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives\\n  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use\\n  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.\"\\n\\nWithin this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I\\nhave found a couple of applications that don\\'t deal well with filesystems\\nthat have been \"mounted\" using join.\\n\\nIn particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very\\nconfused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It\\nwants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then\\ndelete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\\n\\nUnfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic\\nplace other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the\\njoined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original\\n*.doc file, it can\\'t find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you\\nsearch your disk systems, the document is gone.\\n\\nI have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box\\nwhen JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\\\\temp with a 4meg\\nramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\\\temp\\ndir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to \\nreproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think\\nthis is a Windows problem, rather than MKS\\'s, since it works OK under raw\\nDOS.\\n\\nSo, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not\\nbe as robust you would like.\\n\\nWouldn\\'t it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main\\nfile tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,\\nJOIN won\\'t let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch\\nto let JOIN work on network drives, but I don\\'t remember the source.\\n\\nIt\\'s too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would\\navoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was\\nmeant for casual, even ignorant users, so \"mounting\" all the drives in\\none file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry\\nthis over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant \\nusers -- NOT!).

Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n>the way the western press use the word \\'muslim\\' in this Bosnian debacle has \\n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \\n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n-Josip\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

If you have only one printerport \\n( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,\\nyou can assign IRQ2, if its free.

I am guessing that the \"G\" enables the game port and\\nthe \"S2\" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can\\'t get it to work.
